/**
Executes a chain of `MQOperation`s if all of them succeed; otherwise, automatically handles failure
if any of the operations in the chain fail.

Except for the `successBlock`, all the callback blocks of all operations in the chain are overridden
by the callback blocks of the `MQChainedOperation`. Individual operations often have their own
logic for processing results. However, the entire chain needs to perform the same UI callbacks
regardless of which operation in the chain terminates the chain.
